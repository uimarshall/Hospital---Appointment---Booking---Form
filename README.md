# Hospital---Appointment---Booking---Form
This Repository is for the design of a simple hospital appointment booking form, for patients who want to book an appointment to see their doctor. 

The application will have a form that allows users enter the following
information
a. Their name
b. A one hour time slot between 9am and 3pm when they would like to book the
appointment for (this should be a drop down list of 1 hour slots).
c. A description of their symptoms
d. Their date of birth
On submission, their appointment data will be saved. The application will have
another page where it displays a list showing the number of appointments on each
day
