# Hospital Appointment Booking Form
This Repository is for the design of a simple hospital appointment booking form, for patients who want to book an appointment to see their doctor. 

The application will have a form that allows users enter the following information:
1. Their name
2. A one hour time slot between 9am and 3pm when they would like to book the appointment for (this should be a drop down list of 1 hour slots).
3. A description of their symptoms.
4. Their date of birth.
On submission, their appointment data will be saved. The application will have another page where it displays a list showing the number of appointments on each day.

This project will be built with the following technologies.
1. Python
2. Flask
3. MongoDB Database
4. HTML + CSS + Javascript + Jquery + JSON
5. Travis CI
